[Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) is a blog theme originally based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Due to Jekyll's design limitations, it does not natively support internationalization (i18n) and requires third-party plugins for i18n functionality. To enable i18n support for Chirpy without the hassle of relying on third-party plugins, the [hugo-theme-chirpy](https://github.com/geekifan/hugo-theme-chirpy) project migrated the Chirpy theme to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with minimal adaptations. All features of Chirpy are available in hugo-theme-chirpy (though some functionalities may operate differently within the Hugo framework).
